Answers to the multiple choice quiz given during the lecture.

<!--more-->

The Caesar cipher is a **shift** cipher that has a key of 3.

The key of the Caesar cipher is **3**.

The key size of the Shift cipher is **25**.

The inverse of 3 mod 26 is **9**.

If the encryption algorithm of a Shift cipher is C=5P+6, the decryption algorithm of the Shift cipher is **P=21C+4**.

Comparing the Shift cipher with the Hill cipher, **Shift cipher is less secure than Hill cipher**.

<!-- The key size of the Hill cipher is  -->

The key matrix of the Hill cipher can be any **invertible 2x2 matrix mod 26**.

Vigenere cipher is a **polyalphabetic cipher**.

Which of the following ciphers is the most secure? **Vigenere ciphere**.

<!-- A ciphertext has been generated with an affine cipher. The most frequent letter of the ciphertext is "F", and the second most frequent letter of the ciphertext is "C". Break this code. -->

<!-- Suppose that the plaintext "hillcipher" is encrypted using a Hill Cipher to vield the ciphertext HCRZSSXNSP. Find the key matrix of the Hill Cipher. -->
